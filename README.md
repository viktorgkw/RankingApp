## About ℹ️
<strong>
RankingApp is a ASP.NET Core Application with the React.js framework.
<br />
There are two pages, one for the Movie Items and one for the Album Items that you can Rank.
<br />
There are 4 Ranking Levels: Insane, Good, Decent, Worst.
<br />
The application uses LocalStorage that saves data across browser sessions.
<br />
The application is scalable and there can be added a lot of Item Types.
<br />
For now there are limited items and item types.
<br />
The project is open to someone contributing more item types if they so choose.
